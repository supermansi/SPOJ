##SPOJ problems solved
This is a collection of the solution of the problems I've solved on SPOJ. They are entirely done by me.

As of October 20, 2015, I am using online compilers (I know, it sucks) like <a href="http://www.ideone.com">ideone</a> and <a href="http://www.codechef.com">CodeChef</a>'s <a href="http://www.codechef.com/ide">ide</a> which is pretty much like ideone. I hope to shift to something better by the end of this year (2015).

###Edit:
As of March 22, 2016, I am using GCC 5.2 and G++ as I switched to Linux a couple of months ago. Goodbye IDEONE, Hello Terminal! Although I check on CodeChef's IDE (similar to IDEONE) sometimes.

I haven't maintained a collection of my CodeChef solutions as they are more easily accessible via the website. Apart from that, I occasinaly solve problems on HackerRank (again, no archive of solutions). I will try to solve CodeForces and TopCoder soon.

My handles on different OJs are:
<ul>
